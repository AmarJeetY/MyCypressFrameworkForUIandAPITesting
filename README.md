I was not able to finish testing beyond buying an item as on my machine cart window does not open. I am very sorry for this. It does open 
on my friends PC but not on my pc. There is some issue with my pc which prevents it from opening. I spent a lot of time investigating this 
but was not able to fix the issue.So this exercise is incomplete.

Cypress - integration - apitesting - Foreign Exchange => This folder has feature and step definition file for testing API endpoints at below website
